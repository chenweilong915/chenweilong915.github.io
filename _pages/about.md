<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from the Automation major at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2018 for my undergraduate degree, and in 2021 I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from the same university. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree under the supervision of  [Prof. Yanru Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6I1ytegAAAAJ&hl=en) with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, UESTC. My research interests include machine learning, federated learning, large language model and smart grid. I have published papers in top conferences such as ACM MM and journals such as TKDE, TSG, and TCSVT. I was a visiting scholar at the University of Houston under the supervision of [Prof. Han Zhu](http://www2.egr.uh.edu/~zhan2/) during 2023-2024.

My research interest includes AI in smart grid, Recommendation, and Multi-modal in machine learning. I have published 26 papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ukaTvisAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>140+</span></strong></a> .
